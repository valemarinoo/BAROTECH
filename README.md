# BAROTECH PROJECT README

Welcome to the Barotech Project! This repository contains essential files and documentation for the development of a Low Power, Low Cost BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) device designed for Barometric Pressure monitoring. Below is a guide on the contents of this repository and how to navigate through them.

## Folder Structure:

### 1. Allegro folder
- **.brd file:** PCB layout design file for the Barotech device.

### 2. Capture_CIS folder
- **OrCAD circuit schematics:** Schematic diagrams created in OrCAD Capture CIS for the circuit.

### 3. Eurocircuits folder
- **Validation and Evaluation files:** Provided by Eurocircuits for project cost analysis. Includes files for 1, 10, 100, and 1000 PCBs.

### 4. Gerber folder
- **Gerber files:** Files exported from Allegro for manufacturing validation and evaluation.

### 5. MY_ORCAD_LIBRARY folder
- **Library files:** Used for the symbols in the project.

### 6. PADSTACKS folder
- **.pad files:** Created/modified for the components' padstacks.

### 7. FOOTPRINTS folder
- **.dra files:** Created/modified for the components' footprints.

### 8. Schematics folder
- **PDFs:** OrCAD circuit schematic exported from Capture CIS.

### 9. BOM
- **Excel file:** Project's Bill Of Material, detailing each used component (vendor details, value, mounting type, manufacturer, unit price).

### 10. MOVIE
- **Video:** A brief video providing an overview of the Barotech Project and demonstrating the usage of the main tools.

### 11. Technical_Report
- **Technical report:** Detailed documentation covering the project's design history, features, and final implementation.

## How to Use:

1. **PCB Layout:** Open the .brd file in the Allegro folder for the PCB layout.

2. **Circuit Schematics:** Review the OrCAD circuit schematics in the Capture_CIS folder.

3. **Validation and Evaluation:** Explore the Eurocircuits folder for files required for manufacturing validation and cost analysis.

4. **Gerber Files:** Access manufacturing files in the Gerber folder exported from Allegro.

5. **Library Files:** Find symbol library files in the MY_ORCAD_LIBRARY folder.

6. **PADSTACKS and FOOTPRINTS:** Explore .pad and .dra files in the respective folders for component padstacks and footprints.

7. **Schematic PDFs:** View the exported OrCAD circuit schematic PDFs in the Schematics folder.

8. **Bill Of Material:** Open the BOM Excel file for detailed information on each used component.

9. **Video:** Watch the MOVIE for a brief overview of the project and tool usage.

10. **Technical Report:** Refer to the Technical_Report for a comprehensive understanding of the project's design and implementation.
